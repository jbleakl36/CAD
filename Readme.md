### Reflection
In all I was confident going in to this project but when the first problem arose (it wasn't the right mass) I was taken aback. 
The most important thing about the drawings and dimentions is that not EVERYTHING will be directly mentioned. THAT was the 
source of my problems.


### Multi-part Studio 

### Description
We were assingned to create a multi-part object within only one studio with the designs and measurements intact.

### Reflection
This assingment like the last had a prevolent issue that being the misconceptions of size and space given in the design and
measurements. During the question segment of the project, I had issues making new branches and making the onshape system 
cooperate with me so that I could get the desired weight.


### 4.1 Teamwork makes the dream work

### Reflection
In all this process went pretty smoothly, me and Chris worked well to create this. NO problems besides a sketch not showing up
in which we just made it visible again.

### Reflection
This assingment went smoothly as well! Me and Chris worked together and followed the instructions well.
There were no major hiccups besides learning the sweep tool. I was confused at first but then learned eventually.
### 4.3 Teamwork! Assambling the Launcher

### Description
Me and Chris were assinged to create a laucher for the project with the given instructions provided.

### Reflection
For the most part this project went well. But there was one point where I struggled. And that was when I tried to use the revolute mate.
I had a small period in where I mated the two desired objects in the wrong order, eventually that problem was fixed.
### 4.4 and 4.5 - Let's Fly from this Branch!

### Description
We were tasked with learning the branch and merge feature in onshape. And using those features properally.

### Reflection
Learning the branch function was difficult. At first I was just fumbiling around. But then I decided to closely follow the instructions of the page.
I learned how to do it after some trial and error.
