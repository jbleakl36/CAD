### Reflection
In all I was confident going in to this project but when the first problem arose (it wasn't the right mass) I was taken aback. 
The most important thing about the drawings and dimentions is that not EVERYTHING will be directly mentioned. THAT was the 
source of my problems.


### Multi-part Studio 

### Description
We were assingned to create a multi-part object within only one studio with the designs and measurements intact.

### Reflection
This assingment like the last had a prevolent issue that being the misconceptions of size and space given in the design and
measurements. During the question segment of the project, I had issues making new branches and making the onshape system 
cooperate with me so that I could get the desired weight.


### 4.1 Teamwork makes the dream work

### Description
I was partnered with Chris to create a Top, Ring, and Key for our collective project

### Reflection
In all this process went pretty smoothly, me and Chris worked well to create this. NO problems besides a sketch not showing up
in which we just made it visible again.
### 4.2 Teamwork! Key & Prop

### Description
Me and Chris were tasked with creating a Key and Prop for our document

### Reflection
This assingment went smoothly as well! Me and Chris worked together and followed the instructions well.
There were no major hiccups besides learning the sweep tool. I was confused at first but then learned eventually.
### 4.3 Teamwork! Assambling the Launcher

### Description
Me and Chris were assinged to create a laucher for the project with the given instructions provided.

### Reflection
For the most part this project went well. But there was one point where I struggled. And that was when I tried to use the revolute mate.
I had a small period in where I mated the two desired objects in the wrong order, eventually that problem was fixed.
### 4.4 and 4.5 - Let's Fly from this Branch!

### Description
We were tasked with learning the branch and merge feature in onshape. And using those features properally.

### Reflection
Learning the branch function was difficult. At first I was just fumbiling around. But then I decided to closely follow the instructions of the page.
I learned how to do it after some trial and error.

### Onshape Assembilies

### Description & Reflection
We were required to take a multi part course all about Onshape assembilies.

### 01. CREATING AN ASSEMBLY
Overall this section talked about starting an assembly and moving a part to the origin.
It was straightforward and to the point.

### 02. MATING ASSEMBLY COMPONENTS
This section explained the many Mates there are in the Onshape world giving me a bigger understanding
on how all the mates work.
### 03. WORKING WITH AN ASSEMBLY
This section explains the complecated interworkings of mechanics that will greatly improve your efficentcy
and knowledge in Onshape. This includes: Isolation, Hiding Mates, Assembily Folders, etc.
### 04. COMPLETION CERTIFICATE :)

### Reflection
Overall it was fun to put these pieces together to create the final assembly. The most important part of doing this type of assingment is that you should always make sure you properly connect each piece (double check it!).

### Onshape Certification

### Description
This is a test that spans multiple different problems relating to Onshape.

### Evidence/Image
[joshua-bleakley-dbb9e1b2-3a06-434a-9cf2-45676b8ed18b-certificate.pdf](https://github.com/jbleakl36/CAD/files/11376585/joshua-bleakley-dbb9e1b2-3a06-434a-9cf2-45676b8ed18b-certificate.pdf)
### Reflection
This test, if you do the practice and really attempt to understand it, can be relatively smooth. I'm quite pleased to say that I am Onshape certified. As long as
you do the practice there isn't much stopping you from success.
