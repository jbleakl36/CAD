### Reflection
In all I was confident going in to this project but when the first problem arose (it wasn't the right mass) I was taken aback. 
The most important thing about the drawings and dimentions is that not EVERYTHING will be directly mentioned. THAT was the 
source of my problems.


### Multi-part Studio 

### Description
We were assingned to create a multi-part object within only one studio with the designs and measurements intact.

### Reflection
This assingment like the last had a prevolent issue that being the misconceptions of size and space given in the design and
measurements. During the question segment of the project, I had issues making new branches and making the onshape system 
cooperate with me so that I could get the desired weight.
